Not-too-opinionated form handling for React, with Zustand.

**Please note that this is a 🏗️  work in progress.**

- Small API, flexible.
- Just a wrapper around a zustand store, so you can extend this as you wish. Anywhere you can use state tracked with Zustand, you can use this.
- Supports Yup for validation
- Supports basic operations for field arrays.

## Example
Coming soon.

## Why

1. I wanted a performant React form handling library with a simpler API for the features that matter most to me, based on controlled components.
2. I've been using Zustand quite often and I think it's great, handling forms with Zustand would mean fewer moving parts.
3. I'm working on a project where this would make sense.
4. Enjoyment.
