# reformact :ballot_box: :balance_scale:
Form handling for React, with a focus on easy development of complex cases. 

## Philosophy 
The primary goal of this library is to make developing complex forms in React easier and faster, this will always take priority.

I found that I often needed extra dependencies or the same boiler-plate code (or "hacks") to build performant, complex forms in React with other common libraries. 

`reformact` has dependencies, and every other aspect of the library will only ever be secondary to the goal stated above. 


We should be able to let developers handle all of the following: 

- Turn arbitrary objects into forms. 
- Aribtrarily complex fields. 
- Arbitrarily complex fields that depened on one another. 
- Easily access form values from outside the form, for arbitrary sets of fields. 
- Walk-through style forms.
- Easy dynamic arrays of fields.
- Real-time validation of individual fields, and the whole form. 
- Let developers bring their own input components.
